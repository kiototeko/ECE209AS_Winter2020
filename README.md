# Guarding against Screen Content Detection via Remote Acoustic Side Channels

## Abstract
On the research paper with the title of "Synesthesia: Detecting Screen Content via Remote Acoustic Side Channels" by Daniel Genkin, Mihir Pattani, Roei Schuster and Eran Tromer, it is shown that subtle acoustic noises emanating from within computer LCD screens can be used to detect the content displayed on those same screens. This sound can be picked up easily by the microphone built into the screens, and with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier, one can infer, for example, which website the victim was browsing.
In this work, we propose a way to counteract this vulnerability, specifically, by masking with band limited white noise the frequency range where the audible leakage is produced.
