## Abstract
In the paper with the name of "Synesthesia: Detecting Screen Content via Remote Acoustic Side Channels" by Daniel Genkin, Mihir Pattani, Roei Schuster and Eran Tromer, it is shown that subtle acoustic noises emanating from within computer LCD screens can be used to detect the content displayed on those screens.
This sound can be picked by the microphones built into screens, and with a machine learning model one can infer, for example, which website the victim is visiting.
We propose to counteract this vulnerability by either masking the frequency range of the sound produced by the screens with noise, or by actively canceling the sounds.

Participants:

* Julian de Gortari Briseno
